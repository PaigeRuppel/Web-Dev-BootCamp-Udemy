#Introduction to Express

* What is a framework? How is it different from a library  
  * Defining difference : Inversion of control
  - i.e. With a library you are in control and make the call, but within a framework, the control is inverted - the framework calls you
  * Framework - Control flow already exists, basically just predefined white spots you can fill out with your code
  * Library - Collection of functionality that you call
* What is Express?
  * Express is a web dev framework for node
* Why use Express?
  * Express is the most popular and active node web dev framework - robust community
  * Heavy versus Light (how much does a framework do for you)
  	* Heavyweight - few blanks to fill in - Rails - a lot of functionality hidden, harder to understand underlying concepts
  	* Lightweight - many blanks to fill in - Express - more transparent, you know what you get
